# E-Commerce-Website-Testing

I undertook a personal QA project to test an e-commerce website, simulating real-world scenarios and applying fundamental software testing principles. The goal was to gain hands-on experience in software testing and create a portfolio piece to showcase my abilities to potential employers.

- Created a set of detailed test cases covering various scenarios, including positive and negative testing. Test cases encompassed functional, usability, and compatibility testing aspects.
- Conducted extensive manual testing to evaluate the website's functionality, user interface, and responsiveness across different browsers and devices. Reported defects and inconsistencies, ensuring thorough documentation.
- Developed and implemented automated test scripts using selenium, testng framework to expedite repetitive testing tasks, such as login and checkout processes.
- Tested the website's compatibility across major web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure a consistent user experience.
- Evaluated the website's user-friendliness by assessing the ease of navigation, layout, and overall user experience.
